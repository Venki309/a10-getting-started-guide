# Summary

The guide follows a simple learning path: starting with an overview, moving through initial setup, access and login, monitoring dashboards, and finally, exploring next steps and resources. Each section builds on the previous one, allowing users to follow along and understand what to do next.

I chose this structure to reduce complexity by breaking down the process into clear, manageable steps. I used simple language to make the guide approachable for first-time network admins, even those with limited technical backgrounds.

My main assumption is that the audience is new to A10 Control and may not be familiar with advanced networking concepts. As I learn more about the product, I plan to add interactive walkthroughs and GIFs that show step-by-step procedures.

I suggest adding a glossary tab so users can easily refer to specific words, acronyms, and technical jargon used in the document.
