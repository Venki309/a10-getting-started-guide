# Monitoring & Dashboards

The system dashboard displays key information to help you monitor network health and spot issues quickly.

*Visual suggestion: Add an annotated screenshot of the dashboard.*

## System status
View the overall health of your devices, including **compute**, **storage**, **network**, **certificate**, and **microservices status**. Quickly identify any issues or resource constraints to ensure optimal performance.

## Log processing board
Monitor the **change log processing capacity** and **log rate**. Use this information to track system activity, detect unusual patterns, and maintain efficient log management.
